I really liked this article about AI coding and how the current hype is overvaluing it. Billions of dollars are being invested in "vibe-coding" tools that create a lot of apps with security flaws. This blog also talks about the current trend in the software engineering market of replacing engineers with AI. As it states, "that LLMs can replace developers at companies is a testament to how bad that company's codebase and hiring bar is", which signifies that although most junior roles may be seeing their end days, programming is here to stay. The article illustrates that in the current days, AI is very bad at writing original, creative code for complex systems, and it will stay this way for a while because of how it is currently trained. In this case, *a good programmer is always needed.*
